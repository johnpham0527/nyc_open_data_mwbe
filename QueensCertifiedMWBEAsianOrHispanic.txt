business_description	iHealthScreen Inc. has been working on developing large scale database development for telemedicine and electronic health record. The company also has been working on the development of novel innovative software for retinal image grading and diagnosis of diseases, and screen diseases - to predict or detect at early stage. We have software for vessel caliber/width measurement, retinal image calibration, retinal central light reflex quantification, focal arteriolar narrowing and artery-vein nicking quantification which are noteworthy features for early detection of diabetes, hypertension, Cardiovascular Heart Disease and Stroke (CVD). We also aim to develop a system for early screening of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Based on this works, we also aim to develop a prediction model for screening individuals who are at risk of systemic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and CVD. These diseases will be screened by retinal imaging-based system.

business_description	Rainbow Child Cares provide services to children ages from 3 months to five years old. We believe in child-centered pedagogy or student-centered learning. Our program focuses on the childrenâs needs, abilities, interests and learning styles with the teacher as a facilitator of learning. We also strongly believe that young children learn best when they are provided with meaningful instructional experiences that build upon and connect with previous experiences in their everyday life. Hence, by relating math, science, social studies, and art experience to a childâs everyday life, the child will find the information much more interesting and stimulating. We strongly believe that a daily schedule of self-exploration and academic learning will help your child excel in the challenging world that she will face tomorrow.  We are thrilled to have state-of-the-art centers in the culturally-diverse borough of Queens, NY, and we take pride in our bilingual educational programs. All of the children at our centers are exposed to both English and Chinese instruction throughout the day. You will be surprised at how much your child will learn!
